			<h3>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h3>
			    BMI is a simple, inexpensive, and noninvasive surrogate measure of body fat. In
			    contrast to other methods, BMI relies solely on height and weight and with access to the
			    proper equipment, individuals can have their BMI routinely measured and calculated
			    with reasonable accuracy.<br>
			    Furthermore, studies have shown that BMI levels correlate with body fat and with future
			    health risks. High BMI predicts future morbidity and death. Therefore, BMI is an
			    appropriate measure for screening for obesity and its health risks.
			    Lastly, the widespread and longstanding application of BMI contributes to its utility at the
			    population level. Its use has resulted in an increased availability of published population
			    data that allows public health professionals to make comparisons across time, regions,
			    and population subgroups.<br>

			    If your BMI is below 18.5: Your BMI is considered underweight. Keep in mind that an underweight BMI
				calculation may pose certain health risks. Please consult with your healthcare
				provider for more information about BMI calculations.<br>

		        If your BMI is between 18.5-24.9: Your BMI is considered normal. This healthy weight helps reduce your risk of serious health conditions and means youâ€™re close to your fitness goals.<br>

		        If your BMI is between 25-29.9: Your BMI is considered overweight. Being overweight may increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. Consult with your healthcare provider and
		        consider making lifestyle changes through healthy eating and fitness to improve your health.<br>

		        If your BMI is above 30: Your BMI is considered obese. People with obesity are at increased risk for many diseases and health conditions, including cardiovascular disease, high blood
		         pressure (Hypertension), Type 2 diabetes, breathing problems and more. Consult with your healthcare provider and consider making lifestyle changes through healthy eating and fitness
		        to improve your overall health and quality of life.
